                    <li>The Online Examination System is a web-based application designed to streamline
                        the process of conducting examinations for educational institutions or
                        organizations.<br> With the increasing popularity of online assessments, this system
                        offers unique features such as auto-evaluation, speed, accuracy, and paper
                        reduction.<br> It serves both students and administrators, allowing students to answer
                        questions and administrators to manage the question database.<a href="file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/SW%20Porject%202.pdf">Software Engineering Principles</a></li>
